# MCNN
This repo contains a morphological-convolutional neural network (MCNN) trained with extreme learning machine (ELM)

The convolutional and morphological layers are trained using the first part of the approach proposed by Khellal et al in "Convolutional Neural Network Based on Extreme Learning Machine for Maritime Ships Recognition in Infrared Images", Sensors 2018, 18, 1490; doi:10.3390/s18051490
