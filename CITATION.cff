  This repository contains a morphological-convolutional
  neural network (MCNN) trained with extreme learning
  machine (ELM)


  The convolutional and morphological layers are trained
  using the first part of the approach proposed by Khellal
  et al in "Convolutional Neural Network Based on Extreme
  Learning Machine for Maritime Ships Recognition in
  Infrared Images", Sensors 2018, 18, 1490;
  doi:10.3390/s18051490
